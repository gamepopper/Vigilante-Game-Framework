# [Vigilante-Game-Framework](https://github.com/gamepopper/Vigilante-Game-Framework/)
Vigilante Framework (or VFrame for short) is a high level framework built to run with SFML to make 2D games with basic 3D rendering.

## Features
* Sprite Rendering with Frame-by-Frame animation
* Tiled (Texture Repeating) sprites, plus animation!
* Custom Text Rendering
* Full Rectangle and Circle collision with Collision Response
* 3D Graphics (Using Modern OpenGL)
* Game State and Substate Management
* Multipass Post Process Effects

## Prerequisites
* SFML (Preferably 2.4.0 or Higher) and all the required external libraries needed to build projects with it.
* GLEW (If you want to use the 3D rendering capabilities, otherwise you need to define the VFRAME_NO_3D preprocessor to disable it)

## Guides and Info
Documentation for the Vigilante Framework can be found [on this link](https://gamepopper.github.io/Vigilante-Game-Framework/html/). You can also refer to the GitHub Repository's Wiki page for tutorials on how to use some of the features of the framework.
